Sources:
info1.txt: Data governance is responsible for the operation and monitoring of data flows within a company. It is an activity that focuses the efforts of various areas on attention to data quality, security, and controls.
info2.pdf: Data governance is the orchestration of people, policies, processes, and technology so that the company can ensure that data serves the necessary purposes for fulfilling the strategy, as well as preventing fines and legal proceedings that may occur due to mishandling of data.
info3.pdf: Data governance is based on external factors, such as laws and regulations, but also internal factors, such as policies, standards, and processes. Another important foundation in data governance is people and applied technologies.
info4.pdf: Data governance cannot be seen as a project. Data governance is a cyclical and continuous process. Without trained individuals and the understanding that the work needs to be constantly revisited, the activity does not yield the results that companies desire and always blame data governance for being inefficient.
